# DiaryApp


Welcome to my DiaryApp Project


This is my first IOS App and you can guess by the nameâ€¦..It is simple Diary Application where you can keep track of your daily activities and deepest thoughts.

I build this application to understand the basics of IOS developement like how to create views, put different element in the views and connect different views. Additionally, I learned to use firebase authentication and firestore in swiftui through this project.

Features:
The user need to Login to use this app
After Logging in the user can add diary entry by tapping the add button
After adding a diary entry it will be shown on the home screen
The user can sort the diary entries by date
The user can find diary entries of a specific date by tapping the calendar icon
